# Car Purchase Amount Prediction using ANN
# Description
This project aims to predict the total dollar amount that customers are willing to pay for a car using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The model leverages customer attributes to estimate car purchase amounts, providing valuable insights for sales strategies.

# Problem Statement
As a car salesman, estimating how much a customer might spend on a car can help in making targeted sales pitches and optimizing inventory. This model predicts the Car Purchase Amount based on various customer details.

# How It Works
Data Collection and Loading

The project starts by loading a dataset that includes customer details such as age, salary, credit card debt, and net worth, along with their corresponding car purchase amounts.
# Data Exploration and Visualization

The dataset is analyzed and visualized to understand relationships between features and the target variable (car purchase amount). This helps in identifying patterns and potential outliers.
# Data Preprocessing

The data is cleaned and preprocessed by removing irrelevant columns (e.g., customer names and emails) and scaling numerical features. Scaling is important to normalize the data, which helps in improving the performance of the ANN.
# Model Training and Validation

The preprocessed data is split into training and testing sets. The ANN model is trained on the training data and validated using a portion of the training set to ensure it generalizes well to unseen data.
# Model Evaluation

The model's performance is evaluated based on its loss metrics during training. The loss progression is visualized to monitor how well the model is learning and to make adjustments if necessary.
# Making Predictions

Once trained, the model is used to predict car purchase amounts for new customer data. This prediction helps in estimating potential sales figures based on customer attributes.
# Benefits
Improved Sales Strategies: By predicting how much customers are likely to spend, sales teams can tailor their pitches and focus on high-potential leads.
Data-Driven Decisions: The model provides insights based on historical data, leading to more informed decisions and strategic planning.
Enhanced Customer Understanding: Analyzing customer attributes and spending patterns helps in better understanding customer behavior and preferences.
# Additional Information
Dataset: The dataset includes various customer attributes and their corresponding car purchase amounts.
Model Details: The ANN model used in this project consists of multiple layers that learn complex relationships between features to provide accurate predictions.
